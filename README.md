# Hangman
## Overview of the game
Hangman is a game where you have to guess the word, letter by letter, within a set number of lives. 
You start of with 10 lives, and lose 1 for each incorrect guess.
<br><br>
You can also save your progress for a game, so it can be played later. Because there can only be one save record at a time, any saves will overwrite the previous one, so be careful.

Run main.rb to play!
